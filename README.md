# HP3245a_Calibration
Using a Python script to calibrate and adjust an HP3245 precision source with an HP3458a 8.5 digit multimeter.

**The Manual Adjustment: **All but one of the HP3245a adjustments require that you read a series of voltage and current outputs from the instrument and enter the values back into the HP3245a. There are two adjustment options: a full adjustment which consists of 71 readings; 47 of which are voltage, and 24 of which are current. The second option is a voltage adjustment only. Here, only the 47 voltage readings are entered back into the HP3245a. in addition the 10X high voltage output requires the manual adjustment of its offset.
